## Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest

The following app has been developed for teaching purposes. Especially for the Financial Mathematics course taught in the Business Administration Degree at the University of Córdoba, Spain. Although the application is in the Spanish language is easy to follow. The aim is to show a comparison between the simple interest vs. the compound interest and give some explanations at the theoretical level about them: main characteristics, real-world examples of their applications, and the mathematics behind both formulas.
